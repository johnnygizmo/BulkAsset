# Bulk Asset Tools

This adds the ability to perform actions on multiple assets at the same time whether they are in the same file or not.

Features on the Main Channel

## On the local or external files:

-  Move to Catalog / Unassign
-  Set Author
-  Set Description
-  Add/Remove/Copy Tags
-  Rename Assets
-  Clear Assets

This is a free addon! If you want to download the release version, you can grab it from my Gumroad: https://johnnygizmo.gumroad.com/l/bulk-asset-tools

Be aware that when you select multiple assets from different files, each of those files will be loaded, modified and saved in the background. So, this can take a while and it may seem like Blender is frozen. JUST WAIT it will get there eventually. I'm trying to find a good way to show progress
